# Enterprise Architecture Solution - Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Enterprise Architecture Solution's architecture, designed for North Metropolitan TAFE.

## System Overview

The Enterprise Architecture Solution is a cloud-based platform built on Essential Cloud that enables organizations to create, manage, and visualize enterprise architecture artifacts across multiple domains. The solution incorporates GenAI features for intelligent modeling assistance, documentation generation, impact analysis, and pattern recognition.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer

The presentation layer consists of a web-based user interface built using React and Tailwind CSS. It provides:

- **Dashboard**: Visualization of EA artifacts with customizable views
- **Modeling Interface**: Tools for creating and editing architecture elements
- **Repository Browser**: Navigation through the EA repository
- **Admin Console**: Configuration and integration management

### 2. Application Layer

The application layer is built using FastAPI (Python) and provides the core functionality:

- **EA Management**: Creation and management of EA artifacts
- **Visualization Engine**: Generation of diagrams, matrices, and roadmaps
- **GenAI Services**: AI-powered features for modeling assistance
- **Integration Services**: Connection to external systems

### 3. Data Layer

The data layer is implemented using Supabase (PostgreSQL) and stores:

- **EA Repository**: Central storage for all architecture artifacts
- **User Management**: Authentication and authorization data
- **Integration Configurations**: Settings for system integrations
- **Audit Logs**: Tracking of system activities

## Key Components

### Essential Cloud Integration

The solution builds upon Essential Cloud as the foundation EA platform, extending its capabilities with:

- Custom user interfaces tailored for NMTAFE
- GenAI features powered by OpenAI
- Integration with NMTAFE's existing systems

### GenAI Engine

The GenAI engine leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API and Agents SDK to provide:

- **AI Modeling Assistant**: Provides suggestions during modeling
- **Documentation Generator**: Creates documentation from architecture artifacts
- **Impact Analysis**: Analyzes the impacts of architecture changes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies patterns and anti-patterns

### Integration Framework

The integration framework enables connection with external systems:

- **Halo ITSM**: Synchronization with CMDB
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Single sign-on authentication
- **SharePoint**: Document management
- **Power BI**: Advanced visualization

## Deployment Architecture

The solution is deployed using a cloud-based architecture:

- **Frontend**: Deployed as a static web application
- **API Services**: Containerized FastAPI application
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL service via Supabase
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Microsoft Entra ID

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple layers:

- **Authentication**: Single sign-on via Microsoft Entra ID
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **API Security**: API keys and rate limiting
- **Infrastructure Security**: Compliance with ACSC Essential Eight

## Data Flow

### Modeling Workflow

1. User authenticates through Entra ID
2. User creates or edits architecture elements
3. GenAI engine provides suggestions and assistance
4. Changes are stored in the Supabase database
5. Visualizations are generated based on the updated data

### Integration Workflow

1. Integration services connect to external systems
2. Data is synchronized between systems
3. Mapping transformations are applied
4. Changes are audited and logged
5. Users receive notifications of relevant changes

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally:

- Stateless API design allows for multiple instances
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Caching strategies for improved performance
- Asynchronous processing for long-running operations

## Resilience and Availability

To ensure high availability, the system implements:

- Multiple availability zones for critical components
- Automatic failover for database services
- Health checks and automatic recovery
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Technical Constraints

- All data must be hosted within Australia
- Solution must integrate with Microsoft Entra ID
- Required availability of at least 98%

## Future Expansion

The architecture allows for future expansion in several areas:

- Additional integration points with other systems
- Enhanced AI capabilities using fine-tuned models
- Mobile application access
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
